      "Hawkeye - let's be honest for a second. For most not really a favorite character ... and if you've been following the MCU ... you may make him responsible for something that happened to a more favorable character/Avenger. Of course this is quite the segway, because all major characters in this have been affected, directly or indirectly by the actions of said Hawkeye.",

      "Clint Barton(Jeremy Renner, adding layers to a role played for an entire decade now) just wants to celebrate Christmas with his family. The last several years have not been very kind to them. So he goes to New York with the kids. Though they're not hugely impressed with Rodgers: The Musical(a delicious Hamilton parody), it seems to be going well. Then he sees something on the news: apparently, someone wearing the Ronin suit stirred up some trouble. So he, of course, has to figure out who it is, what's going on, and put a stop to it.",

      "Starts off just good, gets pretty awesome, and finishes with a beastly finale. Some of the supporting characters steal the show. And there is some major acting talent with a few great performances, especially by Renner.The action is mostly good. The fight scenes are hit or miss. Some are really unclear while others are awesome. I don't think it's as good a the other MCU shows before it, but I had a good time overall. (1 viewing, 12/22/2021)",

      "The final show of Marvel's banner year on Disney Plus was Hawkeye, which drew heavily on Matt Fraction's and David Aja's run of comics, to provide some much-needed love for the most underappreciated Avenger.",

      "OK IMDB, you win, I'm not allowed to write a bad review about a woke Disney film or mention that it has nothing to do with hawkeye and is a bait and switch.You have taken down every other review i wrote, keep on protecting Disney, keep on protecting the narrative, and keep on trying to pretend this was a good show.",
